Things I will need to do to get this working with python 3

- division of integers can now return a float -- "//" is integer division
- cmp keyword of sort functions is one (looks like one place will need this fixed in SectionLabelLib
- unicode / str fixes --- hopefully most of the content is being handled as unicode anyway?
    - see -- http://python3porting.com/problems.html
    - b"xyz" is now used for creating byte literals
