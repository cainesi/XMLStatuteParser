The program requires python2.7 and a c-compiler to compile an included library..

To setup the required directory structure and compile libraries run "python setup.py".  This will setup certain directories under a "Data" directory in your home directory. The directory locations are specified in the Constants.py file.

Configuration information about the statutes to be parsed is included in the stat_config.txt file.  The use of the configuration file is described in comments within that file.

Once setup and configured, run "python XXXX" to parse the actual statutes.  Output files will be placed in the "Pages" subdirectory under "Data". [To expand -- will we automatically determine changed pages?]
