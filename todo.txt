# immediate TODOs:
# - add indice tables to the Statute initializer (need to think how this will work -- parsing a statute/reg should also rebuild the indices for that instrument)
# - find applicability of definitions
# - parse & decorate for cross references
# - parse & decorate for defined terms

# X - create a decoratedText superclass in the textutil class
