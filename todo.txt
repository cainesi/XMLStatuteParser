# X - Rewrite Statute object so that instead of raw data it takes a StatuteIndex instance and the name of a statute to process
# X - Rewrite test.py so that it is based on statute names as specified in stat_config.txt
# X - written, not tested - Code in langutil that relies on Statute's sectionData in order to create applicability object
# X - Write code to store certain information on statue labels into StatuteData Object - have code to copy in the sectionNameDict
# X - reference series conversion should revert to using local label as base at each new label series -- appropriate Fragments are now marked as "seriesStart" to accomplish this
# X - correct definitions that are not fully captured in SectionLabel.
# X - Finish code to add decorators for section references
# X - Code to find defined terms
# !!! figure out what apostrophes are going wrong -- need to specify utf-8 in html files: <meta charset = "utf-8">
# put marginal notes in output
# extract the citation string (e.g., "R.S.C., 1985, c. C-49") from the main page for statute
# Avoid parsing application ranges in "read as" provisions.
# Code to find one-off definitions
# Add code to StatuteData object to direct location cites to the correct other statuteData.
# Add code to stat_config.txt to determine which statutes are parsed or ignored
# Code in StatuteIndex to convert series of Fragments into references (if references can be found).
# Code to add decorators for other section references
# Code to add decorators for defined terms
# Confirm that page output working correctly
# Code to allow one Decorator to override overlapping decorators when added (for example, if the existing decorator doesn't have a pinpoint object)
# have historical notes handled as a subclass of TextItems rather than as a field of SectionItems, or at least represent them as a DecoratedText object so that they can be marked-up with cross refernces to the implementing/amending legislation.
# fix up paragraphs where the defined term isn't detected correctly.
# move SectionData, DefinitionData, StatuteData, StatuteIndex, etc., into StatuteMetaData module

# Code for tables of contents for each instrument
# Code to add disclaimer footer on each page
# Code to add decorators for historical notes (should be able to lift this from prior project)
# Code to add tables of referencing sections / regulations (have the decorators store the target sectionLabel/instrument as well as the page/anchor, so that we can walk the decorators and find cross-refernces; or have the StatuteIndex keep track of the cross-links as they are querried?).
# Still some problems with handling around italics.  Maybe we should change the getRawText method?
#PrettyPrint class to replace RenderContext (which will offer more intelligent global formatting)
